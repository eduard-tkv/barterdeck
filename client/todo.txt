WHEN YOU HAVE TIME: 
      try making busboy work with passport.authenticate

LAST: separating login and register. 
      registration fully works now, both front and back end. 
      upon successful registration the user is redirected to the login page

      working on login now: 
      04:10PM : login works, just to need to make reducer work with the server response
      09:00PM : login fully works now

      next: image upload and view item. before image upload I need to make saving new user details in the db
      work so when there is a new listing it is saved along with the already registered user. I also need to send username or
      email when sending the list form so I can identify the user.

      When registering and loggin in the token needs to contain user _id from MongoDB

      2018-03-06 10:29PM: Image upload works, it creates a directory with users _id. 
         Now need to save image in that directory. Make a listings item in schema. Listings will contain
         information about listings, images.
